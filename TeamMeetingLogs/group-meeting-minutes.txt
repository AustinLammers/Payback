10/29/24 - Meeting:

__Minutes__
	- Figure out GitHub project board
	- Determine Project Timeline
		- Would like to be mostly finished a week early if at all possible so we don't get caught with a bug we can't track down
	- Decide overarching responsibilities

__Major Decisions__
	- Minimalist color palette (Tenative)
		- Black, Grey, White, Red
		- Maybe CU Theme
	- We are going to go with the Venmo API
		- Could have gone with Splitwise but the API seems to be subpar
	- Decided and confirmed development methodology

		- Dashboard/Home Page
	- Shaan
		- Profile Page
	- Austin

__Follow Up Items__

11/05/24 - Meeting:

__Minutes__
	- Finalize a rough draft for a running browser prototype of the general pages for our application
	- Finalize figma representations of the UI for each page
	- Begin developing back end endpoints to link pages together
	- Decide overarching responsibilities

__Major Decisions__
	- We have decided we will no longer be incorporating any API integration as it's very risky to work with APIs that concern monetary services
	- Instead of using an API we will just be creating some sort of virtual currency system that does not deal with actual money
	- We have also made changes to our "Leaderboard" idea. Instead of displaying all users including those who have 
	  not been staying up to date with payments, we will instead only display the top 3 users on the homepage who
	  have done well at paying on time. For users who are behind on payments, we will simply send them push notifications.
