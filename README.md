# Payback
## Description
Payback is an application that allows for groups people to split bills amongst themselves. Instead of pulling out a calculator, our app will calculate what each member owes based on frameworks like even split, percentages, or absolute dollars and allow all requests for the calculated amount to be sent with a click of a button. We will also allow for users to pay back debts they have accumulated.
